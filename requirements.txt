# The official PyQt-Fit is broken when installed by pip with python 3.6+
# this is due to distribute library dependency, hence, we use the custom wheel.
./libs/PyQt_Fit-1.4.0-py3-none-any.whl

# This is temporary solution, since we would like to remove bkcharts as dependency
# since it has been archived and is incompatible.
